# ReCubed

This is CubeDood: ReCubed, a game which has been in development since late 2023. It is a 2D platformer with a focus on being similar to the original CubeDood, but with new features and improvements. The game is being developed by a small team who are passionate about creating a fun and engaging experience for players.

The original ReCubed was built in JavaScript, but the new version is being developed in TypeScript to take advantage of its strong typing system and other features.
